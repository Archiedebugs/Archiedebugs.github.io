        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm a passionate learner from Kolkata, born on September 4, 2007. I graduated from Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar in 2025, with a score of 92.4% in ICSE (Class 10) and 88.25% in ISC (Class 12). This August, Iâ€™ll be starting my journey as a first-year student at Manipal University, where Iâ€™ll be diving deeper into the world of computer science â€” a field Iâ€™ve been enthusiastic about since Class 6.
          <br><br>
          My interest in computers began with Scratch, where I built and submitted a game to Googleâ€™s Code to Learn competition in Class 8. The same year, I started learning C++, followed by HTML and eventually Java, which Iâ€™ve been studying for the past four years. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms to build a solid programming foundation.
          <br><br>
          Beyond coding, Iâ€™m an avid reader and writer of classic literature. I enjoy exploring themes, styles, and structures in literary works and often write creative pieces of my own. Iâ€™ve also been an active public speaker, participating in Model United Nations (MUNs) nationally â€” experiences that have shaped my communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills.
          <br><br>
          Giving back to the community is something I care about deeply. In Class 9, I contributed to fundraising efforts through platforms like Ketto and the Euphoria Charity Crowdfunding initiative, which helped improve not only lives but also my own perspective and interpersonal skills.

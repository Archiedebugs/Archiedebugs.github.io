    <p data-aos="fade-right">
      Hi! I'm a passionate learner from Kolkata, born on September 4, 2007. I graduated from Mahadevi Birla Shishu Vihar in 2025, with a score of 92.4% in ICSE (Class 10) and 88.25% in ISC (Class 12). This August, I’ll be starting my journey as a first-year student at Manipal University, where I’ll be diving deeper into the world of computer science — a field I’ve been enthusiastic about since Class 6.
      <br><br>
      My interest in computers began with Scratch, where I built and submitted a game to Google’s Code to Learn competition in Class 8. The same year, I started learning C++, followed by HTML and eventually Java, which I’ve been studying for the past four years. Currently, I’m focused on mastering Data Structures and Algorithms to build a solid programming foundation.
      <br><br>
      Beyond coding, I’m an avid reader and writer of classic literature. I enjoy exploring themes, styles, and structures in literary works and often write creative pieces of my own. I’ve also been an active public speaker, participating in Model United Nations (MUNs) nationally — experiences that have shaped my communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills.
      <br><br>
      Giving back to the community is something I care about deeply. In Class 9, I contributed to fundraising efforts through platforms like Ketto and the Euphoria Charity Crowdfunding initiative, which helped improve not only lives but also my own perspective and interpersonal skills.
